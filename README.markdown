RoomRunner
==========

This game is a hobby project for me. The idea is each room is modular in design and can be randomly chosen and put together and it makes a viable level. In theory.

Check out the PLAN file for an overview on the project, sort of like a tentative design document.

This game is a hobby and my first. Feel free to correct mistakes, happy to hear any comments. If you stumble across this repo somehow and think the idea is cool, let me know!

Thanks, Andrew.
